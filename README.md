# Overview

Applied machine learning techniques to stock price prediction by interpreting chaotic market data.

A number of different predictive machine learning models were built to predict future stock prices based on
the lows, highs, openings, closings, volume and NLP sentiment analysis scores of news headlines over the past 5 days. 

The models were trained on 5 years of stock data. Scraped and cleaned 10,000+ rows of data from Yahoo Finance using Python to get needed features.  



# Models and tools 
Built LASSO, Ridge, SVM model with Python and sklearn to predict stock price with R-squared of 0.99.
